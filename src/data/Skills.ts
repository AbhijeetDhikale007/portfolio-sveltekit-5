                info: "Svelte is a modern JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Unlike traditional frameworks like React or Vue, which do much of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts the work to a build step. This means that Svelte compiles your components into efficient JavaScript code at build time, rather than at runtime, resulting in faster performance and a smaller bundle size.\n\nCompile-Time Framework: Svelte compiles components into highly optimized vanilla JavaScript at build time, which reduces the amount of code that needs to be sent to the browser and improves loading times.\n\nReactivity: Svelte uses a unique approach to reactivity. Instead of relying on a virtual DOM, Svelte updates the DOM directly when state changes occur, leading to more efficient updates and a smoother user experience.\n\nSimplicity and Readability: Svelte syntax is designed to be straightforward, making it easy to understand and use. The framework allows developers to write less boilerplate code, which can lead to more maintainable applications.\n\nNo Virtual DOM: By eliminating the virtual DOM, Svelte can directly manipulate the DOM, resulting in less overhead and better performance, especially in dynamic applications with many UI updates.\n\nScoped Styles: Svelte allows for scoped CSS styles, meaning styles defined within a component are only applied to that component. This helps avoid style conflicts and makes it easier to manage styles in large applications.\n\nBuilt-In Animation Support: Svelte has built-in support for animations and transitions, allowing developers to easily add engaging animations to their applications with minimal effort.\n\nRich Ecosystem: While Svelte itself is minimalistic, it has a growing ecosystem of libraries and tools, including Sapper (a framework for building web applications with Svelte) and SvelteKit (a framework for building full-stack applications).\n\nEcosystem Tools: Svelte's ecosystem includes tools like SvelteKit, which streamlines the development of Svelte applications with features such as routing, server-side rendering, and static site generation.",

Developed and maintained by Facebook, React allows developers to create large web applications that can change data without reloading the page. Its component-based architecture and declarative style make it a widely-used choice for front-end development.\n\nComponent-Based Architecture: React encourages the development of reusable components, allowing developers to encapsulate logic and presentation in self-contained units. This modular approach promotes code reusability and easier maintenance.\n\nJSX Syntax: React uses JSX (JavaScript XML), which allows developers to write HTML-like syntax within JavaScript code. JSX makes it easier to visualize the structure of the UI and improves the readability of the code.\n\nVirtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering performance. When the state of an application changes, React creates a virtual representation of the DOM, compares it to the previous version, and updates only the parts of the actual DOM that have changed. This minimizes direct manipulation of the DOM, which can be slow.\n\nUnidirectional Data Flow: React follows a unidirectional data flow model, meaning that data flows from parent components to child components. This makes it easier to understand how data changes affect the UI, leading to more predictable applications.\n\nState Management: React manages component state effectively with built-in hooks like useState and useReducer. For more complex state management across larger applications, libraries such as Redux or Context API can be integrated.\n\nLifecycle Methods and Hooks: React components have lifecycle methods (in class components) that allow developers to hook into different stages of a component's lifecycle. With the introduction of hooks in React 16.8, functional components can now also manage state and side effects, making it easier to share logic between components.",

It was first released in 2015 and has since evolved into one of the leading code editors available. It supports various programming languages and offers a rich ecosystem of extensions for additional functionality.\n\nCross-Platform: VS Code runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, allowing developers to work on multiple platforms with the same experience.\n\nExtensibility with Extensions: The editor has a vast library of extensions available through the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. These extensions can add language support, debuggers, themes, and other tools to enhance the development experience.\n\nIntegrated Terminal: VS Code includes a built-in terminal, allowing developers to run command-line tasks without leaving the editor. This feature supports various shells, such as Command Prompt, PowerShell, and Bash.\n\nIntellisense: Intellisense provides intelligent code completion, parameter info, and quick info, which helps speed up coding by offering suggestions and context-aware assistance.\n\nGit Integration: VS Code has built-in support for Git, allowing developers to track changes, commit, and manage branches directly from the editor. This streamlines the version control process.',

                info: 'GitHub is a web-based platform designed for version control and collaboration that allows developers to store, manage, and track changes to their code repositories. Launched in 2008, it has become one of the most prominent tools in the software development community. GitHub is built on top of Git, a distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds, which allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other’s changes.\n\nVersion Control: GitHub uses Git to manage the versioning of code, allowing developers to keep track of changes, revert to previous versions, and branch off new features seamlessly.\n\nRepositories: A repository (or repo) is where your project files are stored. It includes the code, documentation, and metadata about the project. Repositories can be public (accessible to everyone) or private (restricted access).\n\nCollaboration Tools: GitHub provides features like pull requests, code reviews, discussions, and comments that enable efficient collaboration among team members. Pull requests allow contributors to propose changes and review them before merging them into the main codebase.\n\nIssues and Project Management: The platform includes issue tracking, which helps teams manage bugs, feature requests, and tasks. Project boards and milestones allow teams to organize workflows and track progress on projects.\n\nDocumentation: GitHub supports documentation with Markdown files. The README file in a repository typically serves as the introductory document, explaining the purpose and usage of the project.',
